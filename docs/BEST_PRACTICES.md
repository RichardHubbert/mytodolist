# Coding Best Practices

## File Organization
- Create small and focused files
- Break down large files into multiple smaller modules
- Each file should have a single, clear responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into separate utility files

## Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle

## State Management
- Use appropriate React hooks
- Keep state as local as possible
- Implement proper state initialization
- Handle side effects properly

## Performance
- Implement proper memoization
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use lazy loading when appropriate
- Optimize bundle size

## Code Style
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Write clear and concise comments
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities
- Test component behavior
- Implement integration tests
- Use proper test coverage
